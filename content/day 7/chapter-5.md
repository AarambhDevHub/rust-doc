# Common Borrowing Errors and Solutions in Rust: Detailed Documentation

Rust’s borrowing rules enforce memory safety at compile time, but can lead to common compiler errors when misused. Below are typical borrowing errors, explanations, and practical solutions.

## 1. Cannot Borrow as Mutable Because It’s Also Borrowed as Immutable

**Error Message:**
```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `data` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
  --> src/main.rs:6:16
   |
5  |     let r1 = &data;
   |              ----- immutable borrow occurs here
6  |     let r2 = &mut data;
   |                ^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
7  |     println!("{}", r1);
   |                    -- immutable borrow later used here
```

### Explanation  
You have an active immutable borrow (`&data`) when attempting a mutable borrow (`&mut data`), violating exclusivity.

### Solution  
End or restrict the immutable borrow before the mutable one by scoping or dropping the first reference:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut data = String::from("hello");
    {
        let r1 = &data;         // Immutable borrow
        println!("{}", r1);
    }                           // r1 goes out of scope here

    let r2 = &mut data;         // Now allowed
    r2.push_str(", world");
    println!("{}", r2);
}
```

Or avoid simultaneous borrows:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
    // Use immutable borrows only when needed
    println!("Length: {}", data.len());
    // Then perform mutation
    data.push(4);
    println!("After push: {:?}", data);
}
```

## 2. Cannot Borrow as Immutable Because It’s Already Borrowed as Mutable

**Error Message:**
```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `data` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable
  --> src/main.rs:6:16
   |
5  |     let m = &mut data;
   |             -------- mutable borrow occurs here
6  |     let r = &data;
   |                ^^^^^ immutable borrow occurs here
7  |     println!("{}", m);
   |                    - mutable borrow later used here
```

### Explanation  
You hold a mutable borrow when trying an immutable borrow, violating the rule of one mutable or many immutable.

### Solution  
End the mutable borrow scope before the immutable:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
    {
        let m = &mut data;    // Mutable borrow
        m.push(4);
    }                         // m goes out of scope here

    let r = &data;            // Immutable borrow now allowed
    println!("Data: {:?}", r);
}
```

Or separate operations:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
    // Mutate first
    data.push(4);
    // Then read
    println!("Data: {:?}", data);
}
```

## 3. Cannot Return Reference to Local Data (Dangling Reference)

**Error Message:**
```
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
  --> src/main.rs:3:20
   |
3  | fn dangle() -> &String {
   |            --   ^ expected named lifetime parameter
   |            |
   |            help: consider using the `'static` lifetime
```

### Explanation  
A function attempts to return a reference to data allocated within its own scope, which is dropped when the function returns.

### Solution  
Return an owned value instead of a reference:

```rust
// Wrong
fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    &s  // s is dropped here
}

// Correct: return owned String
fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    s
}

fn main() {
    let s = no_dangle();
    println!("{}", s);
}
```

## 4. Borrowed Value Does Not Live Long Enough

**Error Message:**
```
error[E0597]: `s` does not live long enough
  --> src/main.rs:5:16
   |
4  |     let r;
5  |     {
6  |         let s = String::from("hello");
   |             - `s` dropped here while still borrowed
7  |         r = &s;
   |                ^^ borrowed value does not live long enough
8  |     }
9  |     println!("{}", r);
   |                    - borrow later used here
```

### Explanation  
A reference outlives its referent due to nested scopes.

### Solution  
Ensure the referent lives longer than the reference:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let r = &s;            // s lives as long as r
    println!("{}", r);
}
```

Or limit reference scope:

```rust
fn main() {
    let r;
    {
        let s = String::from("hello");
        r = s.clone();     // Clone to own data
    }
    println!("{}", r);
}
```

## 5. Mutable Borrow Occurs Twice in the Same Scope

**Error Message:**
```
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `data` as mutable more than once at a time
  --> src/main.rs:5:16
   |
5  |     let m1 = &mut data;
   |              -------- first mutable borrow occurs here
6  |     let m2 = &mut data;
   |              ^^^^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
```

### Explanation  
Two simultaneous mutable references violate exclusive access.

### Solution  
Sequence the borrows or use block scoping:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
    {
        let m1 = &mut data;
        m1.push(4);
    }  // m1 ends here

    {
        let m2 = &mut data;
        m2.push(5);
    }  // m2 ends here

    println!("{:?}", data);
}
```

Or split data into disjoint parts:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    let (left, right) = arr.split_at_mut(2);
    left[0] = 10;
    right[0] = 20;
    println!("{:?}", arr);  // [10, 2, 20, 4]
}
```

## 6. Cannot Borrow Data as Mutable Because It’s Not Declared `mut`

**Error Message:**
```
error[E0596]: cannot borrow immutable local variable `data` as mutable
  --> src/main.rs:4:16
   |
4  |     let data = String::from("hello");
   |         ---- help: consider changing this to be mutable: `mut data`
5  |     let m = &mut data;
   |                ^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable
```

### Explanation  
Only `mut` variables can be mutably borrowed.

### Solution  
Declare the variable as mutable:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut data = String::from("hello");
    let m = &mut data;      // OK
    m.push_str(", world");
    println!("{}", data);
}
```

## 7. Conflicting Borrow Across Function Calls

**Error Message:**
```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `self` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
  --> src/lib.rs:10:18
   |
9  |     let r = &self.field;
   |             --------------- immutable borrow occurs here
10 |     self.modify();
   |     ^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
11 |     println!("{}", r);
   |                    - immutable borrow later used here
```

### Explanation  
A method holds an immutable borrow of `self.field` then calls a method taking `&mut self`, violating exclusivity.

### Solution  
Reorder operations so borrows do not overlap:

```rust
impl Data {
    fn do_work(&mut self) {
        self.modify();            // mutable borrow first
        let r = &self.field;      // immutable borrow after
        println!("{}", r);
    }
}
```

Or clone the field if you need to hold data across a mutable call:

```rust
impl Data {
    fn do_work(&mut self) {
        let field_clone = self.field.clone();  // Own the data
        self.modify();                         // mutable borrow ends after
        println!("{}", field_clone);
    }
}
```

## 8. Cannot Return Mutable Reference to Local Data

**Error Message:**
```
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
  --> src/main.rs:3:21
   |
3  | fn get_mut() -> &mut String {
   |             -   ^ expected named lifetime
   |             |
   |             help: consider using `'_` lifetime
4  |     let mut s = String::from("hello");
5  |     &mut s  // s dropped here
```

### Explanation  
Returning a mutable reference to data that will be dropped causes a dangling reference.

### Solution  
Return owned data or accept a mutable reference parameter:

```rust
// Return owned data
fn get_owned() -> String {
    String::from("hello")
}

// Accept mutable reference
fn modify_ref(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(" modified");
}

fn main() {
    let mut data = get_owned();
    modify_ref(&mut data);
    println!("{}", data);
}
```

## 9. Borrow Checker Over-Conservatism (Non-Lexical Lifetimes)

Older Rust versions sometimes prevented safe borrows. Modern Rust uses **Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL)** to allow more flexible scopes.

### Example Before NLL

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
let r = &s;      // immutable borrow
println!("{}", r);
let m = &mut s;  // Error in old Rust: borrow still active
m.push_str(" world");
```

### Example After NLL

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
{
    let r = &s;  // r’s scope ends at println!
    println!("{}", r);
}  // r ends
let m = &mut s;  // Allowed under NLL
m.push_str(" world");
println!("{}", s);
```

| Returning mutable reference to local data         | Local data dropped at function end                           | Return owned data or borrow external data                          |
| Overly conservative borrowing (pre-NLL)           | Compiler’s lexical lifetime inference                         | Upgrade to Rust edition with NLL or refactor scopes                |

Rust’s compile-time enforcement of borrowing rules may appear strict but prevents data races, dangling pointers, and ensures memory safety. Understanding these common errors and solutions will help you navigate the borrow checker and write correct, efficient Rust code.
