# Process Spawning in Rust: Creating and Managing Child Processes with `std::process`

Spawning and managing child processes in Rust gives your program the power to **run other programs automatically**, just as a conductor cues different musicians in an orchestra. This ability is essential for automation tasks, scripting, systems integration, and composing complex workflows.

Here’s a beginner-friendly guide to the basics using the Rust standard library.

***

## The Basics: Using `std::process::Command`

The core tool for launching processes is the `Command` struct from `std::process`.[^1][^2][^3]

### Example 1: Running a Simple Command and Capturing Output

Let's run the OS command `echo Hello World` and capture its output:

```rust
use std::process::Command;

fn main() {
    // Build and run the command
    let output = Command::new("echo")
        .arg("Hello World")
        .output()
        .expect("Failed to execute command");

    // Output is captured in bytes; convert to string
    println!("stdout: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout));
}
```

- `output()` runs the command and waits until it finishes, returning its result.
- The result contains fields for `stdout` and `stderr`. They come as `Vec<u8>`, which you can convert to strings.

***

### Example 2: Spawning a Child Process and Reading Output

You can also spawn a process and interact with it while it's running—useful for long-running tasks.

```rust
use std::process::{Command, Stdio};
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Set up Command to capture stdout
    let mut child = Command::new("ls")
        .arg("-la")
        .stdout(Stdio::piped())
        .spawn()?; // Start the process asynchronously

    let mut output = String::new();

    // Read from the child's stdout
    if let Some(mut stdout) = child.stdout.take() {
        stdout.read_to_string(&mut output)?;
    }

    // Wait for the process to exit
    let status = child.wait()?;

    println!("Process exited with: {}", status);
    println!("Output:\n{}", output);

    Ok(())
}
```

- `spawn()` starts the process but doesn’t wait for it to finish.
- Pipes are used to read child process output.

***

### Example 3: Running and Piping Commands

You can chain processes, just like using pipes in a shell:

```rust
use std::process::{Command, Stdio};
use std::io::Write;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    // Start an echo process and pipe its output
    let echo = Command::new("echo")
        .arg("Rust is awesome!")
        .stdout(Stdio::piped())
        .spawn()?;

    let mut echo_out = echo.stdout.expect("Failed to open echo stdout");

    let mut output = Vec::new();
    std::io::copy(&mut echo_out, &mut output)?;

    println!("Echoed output: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&output));
    Ok(())
}
```


***

## How Child Process Management Works

- **Building the Command**: `.new("program")` specifies what program to run. `.arg("value")` and `.args([...])` add command-line arguments. You can also set environment variables (`.env`), working directory (`.current_dir`), and more.
- **Spawning the Process**: `.spawn()` starts it asynchronously, `.output()` starts and waits for it to finish, capturing output.
- **Interacting with Stdin/Stdout/Stderr**: Use `Stdio::piped()` for reading/writing.
- **Waiting for Exit**: `.wait()` waits for the process, returning its exit status; `.wait_with_output()` captures output and exit status together.

***

## Best Practices \& Notes

- **Always check for errors** when spawning or waiting for processes. Use `.expect()` or handle the `Result`.
- **Platform Differences**: Write platform-independent code when possible, but some commands (e.g., `ls`, `dir`, `echo`) differ between Windows and Unix. To run OS-specific commands, use platform checks:

```rust
if cfg!(windows) {
    // Windows-specific command
} else {
    // Unix/Linux/Mac command
}
```

- **Security Considerations**: Never pass untrusted input directly to the shell. Always use arguments, not string formatting, to avoid code injection bugs.
- **Parallel Processes**: You can spawn multiple children and manage them independently. Keep track of their `Child` handles.

## Summary Table

| **Action** | **Rust Code Example** |
| :-- | :-- |
| Run command \& wait | `Command::new("ls").arg("-l").output()?` |
| Spawn process | `let child = Command::new("myprog").spawn()?` |
| Read stdout | `let mut output = child.stdout.take().unwrap(); ...` |
| Wait for exit | `let status = child.wait()?` |
| Pipe processes | Use `Stdio::piped()` and connect via `child.stdout`/`child.stdin` between processes. |

## Conclusion

Spawning and managing child processes in Rust lets you orchestrate automation, integrate system tools, and script complex workflows reliably. The tools shown here are powerful, composable, and safe when you handle errors and process I/O correctly. Practice with these patterns and you'll be building robust automation and glue code for real-world applications.[^2][^3]
