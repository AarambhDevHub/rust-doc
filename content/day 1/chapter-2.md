# Installing Rust Toolchain (rustup, cargo)

Installing the Rust toolchain is straightforward using the official **rustup** installer, which automatically installs both `rustup` (the toolchain manager), `cargo` (the package manager), and `rustc` (the compiler) in one convenient process.

## Primary Installation Method

## Using rustup (Recommended)

**rustup** is the official Rust toolchain installer and the preferred method for installing Rust.

## For Linux/macOS/Unix Systems (including WSL):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This command downloads and runs the official installer script.

## For Windows:

1. Download and run `rustup-init.exe` from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)

* Follow the on-screen instructions
* You may need to install Visual Studio C++ Build Tools when prompted

## Installation Process

During installation, you'll see options like:

* **Option 1**: Proceed with installation (default) - recommended for most users
* **Option 2**: Customize installation
* **Option 3**: Cancel installation

Choose option 1 for a standard installation. The installer will:

* Download and install `rustc`, `cargo`, `rustup`, and other standard tools
* Install everything to the Cargo bin directory (`$HOME/.cargo/bin` on Unix, `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` on Windows)

Automatically add this directory to your PATH environment variable

## Post-Installation Steps

## 1. Update Your bash Environment

After installation, either restart your terminal or run:

```bash
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

This loads the Rust environment into your current bash session.

## 2. Verify Installation

Check that everything installed correctly:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
rustup --version
```

You should see version information for each tool, confirming successful installation.

## Alternative Installation Method

## Using Package Managers (Ubuntu/Debian)

You can also install Rust through your system's package manager, though this typically provides older versions:

```bash
sudo apt install cargo
```

This installs both cargo and rustc system-wide. However, the **rustup method is preferred** because it:

* Provides the latest Rust version
* Allows easy toolchain management and updates
* Installs per-user rather than system-wide
* Doesn't require sudo privileges

## Custom Installation Locations

If you need to install Rust in a specific directory, you can set environment variables before running the installer:

```bash
export CARGO_HOME=/your/custom/path/.cargo
export RUSTUP_HOME=/your/custom/path/.rustup
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Make sure to add `CARGO_HOME/bin` to your PATH and keep these environment variables set when using the toolchain.

## Managing Your Installation

## Updating Rust

Keep your Rust installation current with:

```bash
rustup update
```

## Uninstalling Rust

If you ever need to remove Rust completely:

```bash
rustup self uninstall
```

This removes all installed toolchains and rustup itself.

## What Gets Installed

The rustup installation provides:

* **rustc**: The Rust compiler
* **cargo**: Package manager and build system
* **rustup**: Toolchain manager for updating and managing Rust versions
* **rustfmt**: Code formatting tool
* **clippy**: Linting tool
* **rust-docs**: Local documentation

After installation, you'll have everything needed to start developing Rust applications, with cargo serving as your primary interface for creating projects, managing dependencies, and building applications.
