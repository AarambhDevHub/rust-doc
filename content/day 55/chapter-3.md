# Macro Workshop: A Beginner's Guide to Testing Strategies

Understanding how to test macros in Rust is like learning to **quality-check a new, custom-built kitchen gadget**. You don't just look at the gadget (the macro code); you need to rigorously test the dishes it produces (the generated code). A poorly tested gadget might work for one recipe but fail catastrophically on another. Effective testing ensures your macro is reliable, correct, and easy to maintain, no matter how it's used.

## The Kitchen Gadget Quality Assurance Analogy ⚙️

### Imagine You've Invented a "Perfect Dicer"

- **The Macro**: Your new "Perfect Dicer" gadget.
- **The Input**: The vegetables you put into it (the code the macro is applied to).
- **The Output**: The perfectly diced vegetables (the code the macro generates).

**How do you test it?**

1. **Behavioral Testing (Integration Tests)**: You use the dicer on carrots, onions, and peppers, then check if the resulting diced vegetables are the correct size and shape. You test the *outcome*.
2. **Visual Inspection (Expansion Testing)**: You use a transparent version of the dicer to watch the internal blades and mechanisms as they work. You test the *process*.
3. **Failure Testing (Compile-Fail Tests)**: You intentionally put a rock in the dicer to ensure it stops safely and gives a clear warning, rather than breaking and sending shrapnel everywhere. You test the *error handling*.

Testing macros in Rust uses these same three core strategies.

## The Core Challenge: Testing at Compile Time

Macros are not functions. They don't run at runtime; they expand into code at **compile time**. This means you can't test a macro by calling it and checking its return value directly. Instead, you must test the **effect** of the code it generates.[^1]

## Strategy 1: Integration Testing (Testing the Behavior)

This is the simplest and most common way to test macros. You write standard unit tests that use your macro and then assert that the resulting behavior is correct. This is the "behavioral testing" from our analogy.

**When to use it**: This should be your default strategy. It's perfect for testing macros that produce a value, create a data structure, or generate a function with specific behavior.

**Example: Testing a `sum!` Macro**
Let's create a simple macro that adds a variable number of expressions together.

**`src/lib.rs`**

```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! sum {
    // Base case for recursion
    ($x:expr) => { $x };
    // Recursive case
    ($head:expr, $($tail:expr),+) => {
        $head + sum!($($tail),+)
    };
}

// Tests are typically in the same file within a `#[cfg(test)]` module
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    // Import the macro so it's in scope for the tests
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_sum_integers() {
        // Use the macro and assert the result
        let result = sum!(1, 2, 3);
        assert_eq!(result, 6);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_sum_with_expressions() {
        let x = 5;
        let result = sum!(x, 10, 3 * 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 21);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_single_value() {
        let result = sum!(42);
        assert_eq!(result, 42);
    }
}
```

**How it works**: We aren't testing the macro itself. We are compiling and running the code *generated by the macro* and using standard `assert_eq!` to verify that the final output is correct. This is robust because it tests what the user actually cares about: the end result.

## Strategy 2: Compile-Time Tests (Testing the Expansion)

Sometimes, you need to ensure your macro generates *exactly* the right code or, more importantly, produces specific, helpful compiler errors on invalid input. This is where "compile-fail" testing comes in.

The standard tool for this is the `trybuild` crate. `trybuild` is a testing harness that attempts to compile test cases and asserts that they either compile successfully or fail with a specific error message.

**When to use it**:

- When testing procedural macros (especially derive and attribute macros).[^2]
- When you need to guarantee that your macro produces a specific compiler error for invalid usage.
- When the exact structure of the generated code is critical.

**Example: Testing a Procedural Macro with `trybuild`**

Imagine we have a procedural macro `#[my_custom_attribute]` that should only be applied to functions. We want to test that it fails to compile if applied to a struct.

1. **Setup**: This requires a procedural macro crate. Add `trybuild` to your `[dev-dependencies]`.
2. **Create the Test Harness**: In your macro crate, create a `tests` directory and a test file.
**`tests/progress.rs`**

```rust
#[test]
fn tests() {
    let t = trybuild::TestCases::new();
    // This will try to compile all files in the `tests/pass` directory
    // and assert that they all succeed.
    t.pass("tests/pass/*.rs");

    // This will try to compile all files in the `tests/fail` directory
    // and assert that they all fail to compile.
    t.compile_fail("tests/fail/*.rs");
}
```

3. **Create Test Cases**:
    - **`tests/pass/01-on-function.rs`**: A file showing the macro used correctly.
    - **`tests/fail/01-on-struct.rs`**: A file showing the macro used incorrectly. Next to this file, you create a `01-on-struct.stderr` file containing the *exact error message* the compiler should produce.

`trybuild` will run `cargo check` on these files and compare the actual compiler output with your `.stderr` "golden files."

## Strategy 3: Data-Driven and Table-Based Testing

When you have dozens of similar test cases, writing a separate `#[test]` function for each is tedious. You can use table-driven tests to check many inputs and outputs concisely.

**When to use it**: When you need to test a macro against a large set of similar inputs and expected outputs.

### Approach A: The Loop-Based Test Table

Create a single `#[test]` function that iterates over a `Vec` of test cases.[^3]

```rust
// Assuming a `words!` macro that splits a string into words.
#[test]
fn test_words_table() {
    #[rustfmt::skip] // Keep our table nicely formatted
    let cases = vec![
        ("Hello world", vec!["Hello", "world"], "basic case"),
        ("extra-fun",   vec!["extra", "fun"],   "separates dashes"),
        ("why?",        vec!["why"],             "ignores question mark"),
    ];

    for (input, expected, message) in cases {
        let actual = words!(input);
        assert_eq!(actual, expected, "Failed on case: {}", message);
    }
}
```

**Pro**: Simple to write. **Con**: If one case fails, the whole test stops, and it can be hard to know which case failed without a good message.

### Approach B: Using a Macro to Generate Tests

This is a more advanced and powerful pattern: create a macro whose job is to generate your tests for you.

```rust
macro_rules! test_words {
    // The macro takes a list of test cases
    ($($test_name:ident: $input:expr => $expected:expr,)*) => {
        // It expands into multiple `#[test]` functions
        $(
            #[test]
            fn $test_name() {
                let actual = words!($input);
                let expected_vec: Vec<&str> = $expected;
                assert_eq!(actual, expected_vec);
            }
        )*
    };
}

// Now we can define all our tests in one clean block
test_words! {
    basic_case: "Hello world" => vec!["Hello", "world"],
    separates_dashes: "extra-fun" => vec!["extra", "fun"],
    ignores_question_mark: "why?" => vec!["why"],
}
```

**Pro**: Each test case is a separate, isolated test. Cargo will run them in parallel and report on each one individually. **Con**: Slightly more complex to set up.

## Debugging Your Macros

Debugging macros can be tricky because the errors happen at compile time. Your most important tool is `cargo expand`.

- **`cargo install cargo-expand`**: Installs the tool.
- **`cargo expand`**: This command will print out the fully expanded source code of your crate, showing you exactly what code your macros are generating. This is invaluable for debugging macro issues.[^1]


## Summary: Which Strategy to Use?

| **Strategy** | **Description** | **When to Use** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Integration Testing** | Use the macro in a standard `#[test]` function and assert the behavior. | **Your default choice.** Perfect for most declarative macros and for testing the "happy path" of procedural macros. |
| **Compile-Fail Testing** | Use a harness like `trybuild` to test for specific compiler errors. | For procedural macros where you need to ensure correct error handling and for testing invalid syntax usage. |
| **Data-Driven Testing** | Use a loop or another macro to run many similar test cases. | When you have a large set of inputs and outputs to test, reducing boilerplate test code. |

By combining these strategies, you can build a robust test suite that ensures your macros are not only correct but also provide a great developer experience with clear error messages for invalid use.
