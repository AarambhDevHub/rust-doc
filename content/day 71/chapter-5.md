# Maintaining Backwards Compatibility in Rust Crates

Maintaining backwards compatibility is a cornerstone of the Rust ecosystem's stability and success. It's a promise to the users of your library (or "crate") that they can upgrade to a new version to get bug fixes and new features without their existing code breaking. This builds trust and encourages a healthy, collaborative software environment. Think of it as a restaurant changing its menu: you can add new dishes, but you shouldn't suddenly remove a popular favorite or change its core recipe without warning your customers.[^1]

## The Core Principle: Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Rust's package manager, Cargo, is built around the concept of **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**. This is a simple set of rules that governs how version numbers are assigned and incremented. A version number is typically written as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.5`).[^2]

- **`MAJOR` version (e.g., `1.x.x` -> `2.0.0`)**: You increment this when you make **incompatible API changes** (also known as "breaking changes").
- **`MINOR` version (e.g., `1.2.x` -> `1.3.0`)**: You increment this when you **add functionality in a backwards-compatible** manner.
- **`PATCH` version (e.g., `1.2.5` -> `1.2.6`)**: You increment this when you make **backwards-compatible bug fixes**.

By default, when you add a dependency in `Cargo.toml` like `my-crate = "1.2.5"`, Cargo treats this as `^1.2.5`, meaning it will accept any version up to `2.0.0`. This is why adhering to SemVer is so crucial; it's what allows `cargo update` to work safely.[^3]

## What is a "Breaking Change"?

A breaking change is any modification to your crate's public API that could cause a user's code to stop compiling. Here are the most common types of breaking changes:[^3]

- Removing or renaming a public function, struct, enum, trait, or module.
- Adding a new required method to a public trait.
- Adding new fields to a struct when all its fields were previously public.
- Adding a new variant to an enum that is not marked as `#[non_exhaustive]`.
- Tightening the generic bounds on a function (e.g., changing `<T>` to `<T: Clone>`).


## Strategies for Maintaining Backwards Compatibility

Here are practical, beginner-friendly strategies to evolve your crate's API without breaking your users' code.

### 1. Additive Changes are Your Best Friend

The safest way to evolve an API is to add to it. Adding new functions, structs, or even new methods to an existing `impl` block is almost always a non-breaking, minor change.[^3]

**Example**:

```rust
// In version 1.0.0
pub struct User {
    pub name: String,
}

impl User {
    pub fn new(name: &str) -> Self {
        Self { name: name.to_string() }
    }
}

// In version 1.1.0, we can safely add a new method.
// Existing code that uses `User::new` will continue to work perfectly.
impl User {
    pub fn greet(&self) {
        println!("Hello, {}!", self.name);
    }
}
```


### 2. Use the `#[non_exhaustive]` Attribute

When you create a `struct` or `enum`, users might want to match on it exhaustively. If you later add a new field or variant, their `match` statement will fail to compile. The `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute prevents this by forcing users to include a wildcard (`_`) arm in their `match` statements, which will catch any future variants you add.[^3]

**Example**:

```rust
// Add this attribute to your public enums.
#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum Status {
    Connected,
    Disconnected,
}

// A user's code MUST include a wildcard arm.
fn handle_status(status: Status) {
    match status {
        Status::Connected => println!("We're online!"),
        Status::Disconnected => println!("We're offline."),
        // This is now required by the compiler. If you add a `Status::Reconnecting`
        // variant later, this code will still compile.
        _ => println!("Some other status."),
    }
}
```


### 3. Provide Default Implementations for New Trait Methods

If you add a new method to a public trait, anyone who has implemented that trait will find that their code no longer compiles. To avoid this, you can provide a default implementation for the new method.

**Example**:

```rust
// In version 1.0.0
pub trait Serializable {
    fn to_json(&self) -> String;
}

// In version 1.1.0, we add a new method with a default implementation.
pub trait Serializable {
    fn to_json(&self) -> String;

    // This is a non-breaking change because existing implementors
    // will get this default behavior for free.
    fn to_pretty_json(&self) -> String {
        // A simple default implementation
        self.to_json()
    }
}
```


### 4. The Deprecation and Re-export Pattern

If you need to rename a function or move it to a new module, don't just delete the old one. Instead, mark the old one as deprecated and have it call the new one, or re-export the new one from the old location. This gives your users a warning and a clear migration path.

**Example**:

```rust
// In a new module: `helpers.rs`
pub fn new_and_improved_function() { /* ... */ }

// In your old module: `lib.rs`
pub mod helpers;

// This makes the new function available at the old path.
pub use helpers::new_and_improved_function as old_function_name;

#[deprecated(since = "1.2.0", note = "Please use `helpers::new_and_improved_function` instead")]
pub fn old_function_name() {
    helpers::new_and_improved_function();
}
```

This allows old code to continue compiling (with a warning) while guiding users to the new API. You can then remove the deprecated item in the next major version (`2.0.0`).

### 5. Managing MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)

Sometimes, to use a new language feature, you need to increase the minimum version of the Rust compiler your crate supports. This is a controversial topic, but the general community consensus is that a **minor MSRV increase is not a breaking change** and should correspond to a `minor` version bump of your crate (e.g., `1.2.0` -> `1.3.0`).

**Best Practices for MSRV:**

- Document your crate's MSRV clearly in your `README.md` and `Cargo.toml`.
- Don't increase the MSRV without a good reason (e.g., to use an important new language feature).
- Try to batch MSRV bumps with other feature releases.


## Tools for Checking Compatibility

You don't have to do this all by hand. The ecosystem provides tools to help you avoid accidental breaking changes.

- **`cargo-semver-checks`**: A linter that you can run in your CI pipeline. It compares the public API of your new version against the previous version and will fail if it detects a breaking change that is not accompanied by a major version bump.

By embracing Semantic Versioning and these defensive coding patterns, you can create a stable, reliable crate that developers will trust and enjoy using for years to come.
