# Semantic Versioning in Rust Projects: A Beginner's Guide

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a standardized system for numbering software releases to communicate the nature of changes made in each new version. In Rust, SemVer is a critical component of the ecosystem, enabling the Cargo package manager to handle dependencies safely and efficiently. Understanding SemVer is essential for both publishing and using crates.

## The Core Principles of Semantic Versioning

SemVer uses a three-part version number: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., `1.4.2`). Each part is incremented based on the following rules :[^1][^2]

- **MAJOR** version: Incremented when you make **incompatible API changes**. This signals to users that upgrading will likely require them to modify their code.
- **MINOR** version: Incremented when you **add functionality in a backward-compatible manner**. Users can safely upgrade to a new minor version without breaking their existing code.
- **PATCH** version: Incremented when you make **backward-compatible bug fixes**. These are safe to upgrade for bug fixes without affecting the API.


## Why Semantic Versioning is Important in Rust

Rust's package manager, Cargo, relies heavily on SemVer to manage dependency compatibility and updates. When you specify a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file, like `serde = "^1.0"`, you are telling Cargo to accept any version that is greater than or equal to `1.0.0` but less than `2.0.0`. This allows you to automatically get bug fixes and new features without breaking your code.[^3]

### Benefits of Using Semantic Versioning

- **Automated Safety**: CI/CD pipelines can be configured to automatically approve patch and minor updates while flagging major version changes for manual review.[^4]
- **Stable Dependency Graphs**: Cargo can resolve complex dependency trees by selecting compatible versions of crates, reducing the risk of "dependency hell."
- **Clear Communication**: It provides a clear contract between the crate author and the user. A major version bump signals that an upgrade will require effort, while minor and patch updates signal safe improvements.[^5]


## Best Practices for Applying Semantic Versioning

1. **Initial Development**: Start your project at version `0.1.0`. Major version zero (`0.y.z`) is for initial, rapid development where anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.[^1]
2. **Reaching Stability**: Once your API is stable and being used in production, you should release version `1.0.0`.
3. **Incrementing Correctly**:
    - Increment the **MAJOR** version for any breaking changes, such as removing a public function, changing a function's signature, or altering a struct's fields.[^3]
    - Increment the **MINOR** version when adding new features that do not break existing code, such as adding a new function or a new field to a struct with a `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute.
    - Increment the **PATCH** version for bug fixes that are backward-compatible.
4. **Immutability of Releases**: Once a version has been published, its contents must not be modified. Any changes must be released as a new version.[^3]
5. **Pre-releases**: For testing upcoming versions, you can use pre-release tags, such as `1.3.0-rc.0` (release candidate) or `2.0.0-alpha.1`. Cargo will not select these versions unless explicitly requested.[^2]

### Tooling for SemVer Compliance

To help enforce these rules, the Rust ecosystem provides tools like `cargo-semver-checks`, which can be run in your CI pipeline to detect accidental breaking changes before you publish a new version.[^6]

## Example of SemVer in `Cargo.toml`

When you specify a dependency in `Cargo.toml`, you define a version requirement. Here are some common examples :[^7]

- `serde = "1.0.4"`: This is equivalent to `^1.0.4`, meaning any version from `1.0.4` up to (but not including) `2.0.0` is acceptable.
- `serde = "=1.0.4"`: This pins the dependency to the exact version `1.0.4`.
- `serde = ">=1.0.4, <1.1.0"`: This allows any version in the range `[1.0.4, 1.1.0)`.

By adhering to Semantic Versioning, you contribute to a more stable and predictable Rust ecosystem, making it easier for developers to build and maintain robust applications.
